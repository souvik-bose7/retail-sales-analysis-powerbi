3️⃣ Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
- 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform for dashboard creation.
- 📂 Power Query – Used for cleaning, transforming, and reshaping raw CSV data.
- 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Created calculated measures for KPIs like profit margin, order value, and category distribution.
- 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established between tables (Orders.csv and Sales.csv) using Order ID as a key to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
- 📁 File Format – .pbix for development, .png for dashboard preview.

4️⃣ Data Source

The dashboard is powered by two CSV files:
1.	Orders.csv → Order ID, Order Date, Customer Name, State, City

2.	Sales.csv → Order ID, Amount, Profit, Quantity, Category, Sub-Category, Payment Mode
   
These were cleaned and merged in Power Query before modeling in Power BI.
